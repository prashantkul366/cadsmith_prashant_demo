"""Standard dimensions, retrieved for whatever a request mentions.

The Planner is the one agent with no retrieval at all.  KB1 gives the Coder
CadQuery API docs and KB2 gives the Error Refiner error fixes, but the agent
that decides every target dimension gets the bare prompt and is told, in its
own system prompt, to "estimate reasonable engineering dimensions" when the
request does not state them.  Estimating is exactly where a model invents a
22mm pilot bore for a NEMA 23 that needs 38.1mm.

This is the missing third knowledge base: not geometry, not API docs, just
the numbers, pulled from ``standards.py`` for the things a request actually
names.  A request that names nothing standard gets nothing injected.

Retrieval is conservative on purpose.  Wrong facts are worse than none: they
would be handed to the Planner as authoritative and propagate through the
plan, the code and the Judge's acceptance criteria together.
