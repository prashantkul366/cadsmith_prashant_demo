"""Standard hardware, generated parametrically as CadQuery source.

The point of generating rather than importing: what comes out is *code*, with
the standard's dimensions as named assignments at the top.  So the app's code
panel shows real numbers, the parameter-patch editor can rewrite them, and
the Refiner can restructure the part - none of which is possible with a
downloaded STEP, which is a frozen shape with no history and no parameters.

    from app.catalog import parts
    screw = parts.socket_head_cap_screw("M8", 30)
    print(screw.code)        # standalone CadQuery, assigns `result`

Threads are not modelled.  A swept helix on a single M8x30 measured 283x the
build time and 224x the STEP size of a plain shank (2.5s and 1.3MB for one
screw), which is why every production CAD library shows fasteners with plain
shanks too.  Pass ``threaded=True`` if you want the real helix for a hero
render and can pay for it.

Origins are chosen so the part lands where it belongs when translated to a
feature: screws and bolts sit with the *bearing face under the head* at
z=0, everything else on its own base at z=0, axis along +Z.
