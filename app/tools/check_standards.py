"""Cross-check our dimension tables against BOLTS.

``app/catalog/standards.py`` was transcribed by hand, and it says so: the
numbers are load-bearing for real engineering and a typo in them would
propagate silently through the plan, the code and the Judge together. This
compares every value against BOLTS, an independent open library of technical
specifications, so the tables are checked rather than trusted.

    git clone https://github.com/boltsparts/boltsparts.git /tmp/bolts
    .venv/bin/python -m app.tools.check_standards --bolts /tmp/bolts

**Nothing is copied.** BOLTS' data files are LGPL-2.1+ and its tooling is
GPL-3.0; this repository has neither in it and does not depend on either.
The tool reads a checkout you supply and reports agreement or disagreement.
A dimension is a fact and cannot be copyrighted; a compilation of them can
be, which is why this verifies rather than vendors.

Where the two disagree, neither is automatically right - BOLTS cites its own
sources per table and is itself a transcription. A disagreement means go and
read the standard.
