"""Record demo runs with real geometry and scripted agent replies.

Every artifact these runs produce is genuine: CadQuery builds the solid, the
OCCT kernel measures it, VTK renders the three views the Judge inspects.  What
is *not* genuine is the agent dialogue - the design plan, the CadQuery source
and the Judge's wording are scripted here rather than returned by Claude, so
the app can be demonstrated and tested without an API key.

Runs seeded this way are tagged ``source: "fixture"`` in meta.json and the UI
labels them accordingly.  A run recorded with a real key is tagged ``live``;
once you have one, prefer it for demos.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python -m app.tools.seed_demo_run            # seed all scenarios
    .venv/bin/python -m app.tools.seed_demo_run --list
