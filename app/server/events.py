"""Event schema and sink for streaming live CADSmith pipeline progress.

The pipeline in ``autofab/`` is synchronous and reports progress only by
printing.  This module defines the structured event stream the web app
consumes instead.  Nothing here imports ``autofab`` - the instrumentation
that produces these events lives in ``instrument.py``.

Events are append-only per job.  Each sink keeps the full history in memory
and mirrors it to ``events.jsonl`` on disk, so a browser that reconnects (or
arrives late) can replay the run from sequence 0 without special-casing.
