"""A hard ceiling on what one run may spend.

The pipeline is a loop: plan, code, execute, judge, refine, repeat.  Every
turn of it is a paid model call, and the vision Judge sends a rendered image
each time, so the input side grows faster than the output side.  On a metered
backend like Bedrock a runaway loop is not a slow run, it is a bill.

So a run carries a token budget.  It is checked before each model call, and
when the next call would exceed it the run stops with an explanation instead
of continuing.  Tokens rather than dollars, for two reasons: tokens are what
the API actually reports, exactly, on every call; and Bedrock is billed by
AWS at AWS's own rates, which this app has no business guessing.

If you want the ceiling expressed in money, give it the rates from your own
AWS pricing page - see ``RATE_ENV``.  Nothing here invents a price.
