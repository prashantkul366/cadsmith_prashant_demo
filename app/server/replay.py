"""Replay a recorded run at presentation speed.

A live demo can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the work: a
rate limit, a flaky network, a part that happens not to converge this time.
Replay removes that risk without faking anything - it re-emits the events a
real run produced, against the artifacts that run actually exported.  The
geometry, the source, the renders and the Judge's words are all the originals.

What replay does change is timing.  Real gaps are scaled down and capped, so
a forty-second Opus call does not stall a demo; the recorded durations stay
in each event's own data for anyone who looks.

Replays are marked as such in the UI and on disk.  They are a recording, not
a simulation, and they are never presented as a fresh run.
