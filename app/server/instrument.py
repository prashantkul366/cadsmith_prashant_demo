"""Makes the stock CADSmith pipeline observable - without modifying it.

Everything under ``autofab/`` is left byte-for-byte as published, so
``run.py`` and both benchmark scripts stay reproducible.  Observability is
achieved from the outside, in three ways:

1. ``Pipeline`` builds its executor and validator as plain instance
   attributes, so :class:`InstrumentedPipeline` swaps in subclasses after
   ``super().__init__()`` runs.
2. ``pipeline.py`` and ``validator.py`` both reach the agents through the
   *module object* (``from . import agents`` then ``agents.plan(...)``), so
   wrapping the module's function attributes intercepts every LLM call.
3. The current job is carried in a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar`, so the
   wrappers are installed once, globally, yet stay correctly scoped when
   several jobs run on different worker threads.  With no context set the
   wrappers are pass-throughs, so importing this module never changes
   behaviour for anything outside the web app.

The iteration number is recovered from the ``name`` argument the pipeline
passes to the executor (``f"{name}_iter{iteration}"``) rather than by
scraping log strings, which keeps the coupling to a documented call
signature instead of to human-readable text.
