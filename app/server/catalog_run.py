"""Serve a standard part from the catalogue instead of generating it.

When a request is unambiguously a standard part - "an M8x30 socket head cap
screw", "a 20 tooth spur gear module 2" - there is nothing for five agents to
work out.  The dimensions come from the standard, the geometry is exact, and
a language model can only introduce error.  So the catalogue answers directly.

Two things keep this honest.

*It is never a guess.*  ``router.select`` refuses anything ambiguous,
under-specified, or merely mentioning a standard part inside a custom one,
and it builds and verifies every candidate before returning it.  Whatever
reaches here is already known to be a sound solid.

*It is never disguised as pipeline output.*  The version is stamped
``source="catalog"`` and the UI badges it, because a part that no agent
produced must not be shown as evidence that the agents work.  It carries no
Judge verdict for the same reason - there was no Judge.

The part still runs through the same Executor the pipeline uses, so the
artifacts, the geometry JSON and the exports are identical to any other run;
only the route to the code differs.
