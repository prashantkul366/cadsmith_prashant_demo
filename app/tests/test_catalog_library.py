"""The catalogue, end to end: every part builds, and only the right ones route.

Three things this has to establish.

*Every part the catalogue can serve is sound.*  Not "imports fine" - built in
the OpenCASCADE kernel, one valid watertight solid, and where a closed-form
volume exists, within tolerance of it.  This is the test that would have
caught cq_warehouse's washers, which are non-closed shells with twice the
correct volume.

*Routing is conservative.*  A request naming a standard part inside a bigger
one ("a bearing housing for a 6203") is a custom part and must reach the
model.  A wrong substitution here hands back confidently wrong hardware.

*What comes out is still editable.*  The point of generating over importing
is that the result is parametric, so the parameter editor must be able to
find and rewrite a gear's tooth count.
