"""Do the published dimensions actually reach the Planner?

Two things are worth proving and one is worth being honest about.

Provable here: the right facts are retrieved for a request, and the wrapped
``agents.plan`` really does hand them to the model - checked by capturing the
exact text that reaches the LLM boundary, not by trusting the wrapper.  And
that with no run context the prompt is untouched, so ``run.py`` and the
benchmark scripts behave as published.

Not provable here: whether a given model then *uses* the numbers.  That needs
a real key and a real model; ``app/tools/grounding_ab.py`` runs that
comparison when you have one.
